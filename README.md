## GPX Import Methods

Currently, GPX tracks can be imported in the following ways:

1. **OpenStreetMap Traces**  
   - Tracks must include elevation and time data.  
   - Copy the numeric ID from the OSM trace URL, e.g.:  
     ```
     https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces/12056327/data
     ```  
     Here `12056327` is the ID you enter in the app.  
   - Import the GPX into OSM first if editing is needed.  
   - The app downloads the GPX from OSM and displays it on your watch.  

2. **Manual import using Bugjaeger**  
   - Install [Bugjaeger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.sisik.hackendebug) on your phone and pair via wireless debugging.  
   - Keep your watch on charge.  
   - Navigate to:  
     ```
     storage/emulated/0/Android/Data/com.keeperrl.offlinemapsforwearos/files/download
     ```  
   - At the top of Bugjaeger, click the **up arrow** and import the GPX file you want.  
   - Currently, this is the most reliable method until a new service can be integrated.  

> **Note:** RWGPS and Pastebin imports are currently disabled or unreliable. The app now uses OpenStreetMap for GPX import.  

> **Tip:** If your GPX does not include elevation or time data, you can use [GPX.studio](https://gpx.studio) to edit your GPX:  
> * Add elevation and time data.  
> * Set a speed or pace if needed.  
> * Save the GPX, then import it to OSM, and finally import into the app.
